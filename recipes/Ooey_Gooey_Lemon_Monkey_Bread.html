        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Ooey-Gooey Lemon Monkey Bread is a sweet, pull-apart treat made from
          soft dough balls coated in a sticky lemon-sugar glaze. Baked until
          golden and bubbly, each piece is bursting with bright citrus flavor
          and a gooey, caramelized coating. It’s zesty, indulgent, and perfect
          for sharing—like sunshine in every bite.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Monkey Bread</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>cooking spray</li>
          <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1 packed tablespoon grated lemon zest, plus more for garnish</li>
          <li>
            2 (16.3-ounce) cans Southern Homestyle biscuits (such as Pillsbury
            Grands), cut into quarters
          </li>
          <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
          <li>1/4 cup light corn syrup</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lemon Drizzle</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1/2 cup creamy lemony supreme frosting (such as Duncan Hines)</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste (or vanilla extract)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180
            degrees C) with a rack positioned in lower third position. Grease a
            (12-cup) Bundt pan with cooking spray. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine granulated sugar and lemon zest in a large bowl; rub sugar
            and zest together until fragrant. Add biscuit pieces and toss to
            coat each piece evenly with sugar mixture; do not shake off excess
            sugar.
          </li>
          <li>Arrange pieces in the prepared pan.</li>
          <li>
            Melt butter, corn syrup, lemon extract, and any remaining
            lemon-sugar mixture (scant 1/2 cup) in a small saucepan over medium
            heat, whisking constantly until sugar is dissolved and mixture is
            fully combined. Pour butter mixture evenly over biscuits in the pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown and a
            thermometer inserted into the outer edges of the center biscuits
            registers 190 degrees F (87 degrees C), about 40 minutes. Let cool
            in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a serving platter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Microwave frosting in a small microwave-safe bowl until runny, 10 to
            15 seconds. Stir in vanilla until smooth. Drizzle glaze evenly over
            Monkey Bread.
          </li>
